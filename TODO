Rewrite to OOC
 * ascii86 [done]
 * gzip    [done]
 * cmatrix [done]
 * util    [done]
 * mops    [in progress]

Write
 * mcrypt
 * util - function to generate a sha 512 hash for password hashing

Bugfixes
 * ascii86 - ignore newlines and spaced in decode86       [done]
 * deflate - make use of total_out in write() and close() [no measurable improvement]
 * think about adding more diffusion to the password... possibly use XOR 8 chars in advance? 
   but this would change the format....                   [in progress]
