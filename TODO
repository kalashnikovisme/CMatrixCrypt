Rewrite to OOC
 * ascii86 [done]
 * gzip    [done]
 * cmatrix [done]
 * util    [done]
 * mops    [in progress]

Write
 * mcrypt
  - postpwned until mops is written
 * util - function to generate a sha 512 hash for password hashing
   [done] sha512.cpp has been written which takes care of this
 * mops - write the actual matrix encryption code
  - needs to be a class
  - needs to be able to work with streams
  - option to calculate the hashsum of the given password
 * tests - write or expand tests for all code involved
  - every single part of the public API needs to have tests

Bugfixes
 * object files - move them all to obj/ to declutter src/ [done]
 * ascii86 - ignore newlines and spaces in decode86       [done]
 * deflate - make use of total_out in write() and close() [done but no improvement]
 * remove all debugging code from libraries that work     []
 * change the code to use size_t where appropriate        []

Algorithm Improvements
 * think about adding more diffusion to the password... 
   possibly use XOR 8 chars in advance?                   [in progress (phash.cpp)]
 * work on an improved avalance effect for additional
   crpytographic strength... XOR, hashes, etc.?           []
